"""
Note: Only allowing the letters A to Z may be too limiting, especially if you want to create a word list in a language other than English.
In that case, you could use a regular expression. The \w special sequence matches most of the characters that can be part of a word in any language.

You get a more permissive filter by replacing line 14 with the following:

if re.fullmatch(r"\w+", word):
If you go this route, remember to import re at the top of your code. 
This filter will also allow underscores, so something like guess_num will be included in your word list. 
You can avoid underscores and numbers by using r"[^\W0-9_]+".
This uses a negative character group, listing characters that arenâ€™t allowed in the words.

You can use the script to, for example, convert your current version of wyrdl.py to a word list as follows:
$ python create_wordlist.py wyrdl.py wordlist.txt
